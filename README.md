# Automate your life with Bash

> Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimal human assistance. - Wikipedia

Computers are really useful for repetitive tasks. If you're finding yourself frequently typing the same old  commands all the  time you can consider creating a script to procedurally perform the tasks. In the process you'll learn to think more algorithmically about the tasks at hand and be more efficient in your keystrokes.

*This tutorial uses Bash as the language  but the concepts can be applied to any scripting languages and many scripting languages can call bash from them*

## What is Bash?

GNU Bash is a Unix shell and command language for the GNU project. It was first released in 1989 and has been widely used for most Linux distubutions, MacOS, and can be installed for Windows 10.

### Configuration
- Aliases are exist for the session. You can make them permanent by adding them to you .bashrc or .bash\_aliases file
- you can add a bin folder so you can run the scripts globally
